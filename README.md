*One junction for health*

### What problem does our application solve for users?

Have you ever struggled to find a specific medication, even after looking everywhere for it? Let me tell you that you're not alone, we’ve all been through this process of being incapable of controlling the critical situation we’re in.
We’re happy to announce that through the chance we’ve been given in the challenge of junction competition, we were able to work on an application that deals with this kind of situation. Moborne’s application for patient needs.

### Let’s imagine a scenario:

Grandfather Ahmed arrives at Hospital X, he takes a ticket to reserve a place for an appointment with a doctor. At the exit, he asks the nurse, the nearest pharmacy to buy his medicine, she replies that the closest is in front of the hospital, but which is often in lack of stock of certain medicine, she therefore suggests using Moborne’s application for patient needs to find the nearest pharmacies which contain all the medications mentioned in the prescription. 





### Features:

* An interactive kiosk at the door of a hospital, private or public, would help patients quickly find the medications with the best route and the necessary information about them.

* The application is linked to databases administered by pharmacists who  ensure stock management in different areas of Algeria, and a non-permanent database administered by the doctor of each hospital, renewable every 24 hours. 

* The application can be used to search for a medication in the nearest pharmaceutical stores and this outside of the prescription issued by the doctor. 

* The application allows you to search about the nearest hospitals according to the availability of beds, machines and number of places.

* The historical data collected can be used for statistical purposes allowing forecasts to be made in order to optimize the production of medical stock. 

### We have four main pages:
**Reservation:** we can use this page to reserve a place in the waiting line after choosing the right department (Nutrition and Dietetics, Microbiology…….)

**Hospitals:** this option allows you to search about the nearest hospitals according to the availability of beds, machines and number of places.

**Pharmacies:** it can be used to search for a medication in the nearest pharmaceutical stores and this outside of the prescription issued by the doctor. It also shows you the itinerary to the pharmacy.

**Emergency:** this option allows you to reserve a place and have higher priority in the waiting line.

### Who does our app serve?

Our product will be very attractive to both government and private sectors 
as it will improve the quality of service for the customers which is very important when dealing with hospital patients:

* Removing the frustration of having to waiting in line for an unknown period of time not knowing how many people are before you or how much it will take to get to you.
* It will also allow you to go do something else while it’s not your turn as you have already reserved your place, no need to sit there and make sure nobody skips the line.
* Automatically process the list of medicament the doctor prescribed you and finds the closest pharmacy that contains all of them or the most efficient route to get them from different pharmacies.
* In case of an emergency patient if the queue is already full and long it will propose nearby hospitals with available room.

By improving the quality of service that the patients revice you are reducing the stress put on the staff of the hospital in many different ways and thus improve the quality of service that these employees provide.


### You may ask…
### What makes your app better in interactive kiosks than a mobile app?

* Quick and easy to use, 
* Avoid spam and security breaches,
* Less expensive in terms of implementation and deployment than a mobile application 
* Workload reduction.

### Why should customers choose you over your competition?

The impact of our product will range from highly improving the service quality for the customer, reducing the stress of the employees, making the hospital more organized and clean, to even saving the life of emergency patients by redirecting them to nearby hospitals. Which will make your services not only more attractive than others but you will also be able to handle more customers than usual.
